##  Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Atari_RL_Games` | Implementation of Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents using TF-Agents to play Atari games like Seaquest and Boxing. |
| `CitationModels` | Deep learning-based models for citation recommendation and explanation in academic research using Transformers. |
| `VisionModels(Inpainting)` | Inpainting with Stable Diffusion to modify or reconstruct masked areas in images, combined with segmentation. |
| `TF_ForexPredictor` | A time series forecasting model using LSTM to predict forex prices based on historical currency data. |
| `Transformers` | BERT and GPT-based models fine-tuned for text classification and generation tasks. |
