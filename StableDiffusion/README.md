# 🎨 Stable Diffusion Text-to-Image Generation

This project uses the **Stable Diffusion pipeline** to generate high-quality images from natural language prompts using the `diffusers` library. It leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to produce novel images based solely on text input.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Use pre-trained Stable Diffusion models to generate images from prompts.
- Automate generation of multiple images with different prompts.
- Save generated images locally for visualization or further processing.

---

## 📊 Main Packages Used

- `diffusers`
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library)

> 💡 GPU recommended for faster generation.
