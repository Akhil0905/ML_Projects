# ðŸ§¾ CitationModels

This project focuses on recommending and explaining academic citations using NLP and Transformer-based models. It includes citation sentence encoding, reference suggestion, and explanation generation using pretrained language models.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Automate citation recommendation and justification
- Fine-tune Transformers (e.g., BERT, T5) for contextual understanding
- Generate explanations for suggested references

---

## ðŸ“Š Main packages used:
 - transformers
 - datasets
 - torch
 - nltk
 - pandas, matplotlib

**Note: Ensure Hugging Face and tokenizer models are downloaded before training.**

---

## ðŸ§  Notes
 - Utilized both encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures
 - Included decoding strategies for citation explanation
 - Custom dataset handling for paper-reference pairs
